# Multiple_years_yield_prediction
Multiple years' yield prediction based on soil, weather and UAV image data.

This is the code related to our paper 'Prediction of cotton yield based on soil texture, weather conditions and UAV imagery using deep learning' authored by Aijing Feng, Jianfeng Zhou, Earl Vories and Kenneth Sudduth. In this paper, we predicted cotton yield vairiability based on soil, weather and UAV image data.
